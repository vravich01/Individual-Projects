# Individual-Projects
### Hi! This is the repo for individual projects relevant to my field of study: computer science and applied math.

# Table of Contents...
### C & C++ Projects:
##### Concurrent Processes & Multi-Threading Exercises: A set of small exercises that involve solving problems using concurrent programming.
### Java Projects:
##### Reversi AI (Work in Progress): Currently, just a command line copy of the game Reversi; goals to complete coding the game and begin training a CPU
### Matlab Projects:
##### Floating Point Arithmetic & Sensitivity Analysis: Explores the innacuracies of analytic solutions when using machine calculations..
##### Monte Carlo Methods: Explores the benefits of Monte Carlo estimation methods by attempting to numerically figure out the area of a heart shape.
##### SVD Image Processing: Explores the usage of SVD-k trunctions of matrices that represent image data to perform (and undo) operations on images.
##### Image Classification & Model Training: Explores rudimentary visual recognition by using linear classification and training to identify images.
